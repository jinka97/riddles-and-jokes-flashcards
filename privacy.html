        <p>Last updated: [Date]</p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Riddle & Joke Flashcards. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.</p>
        <p>Bolt & Chatty Flashcards uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data, such as page views and interactions, to improve our app. This data may include your IP address, device type, and browser information. We do not collect personally identifiable information.</p>

        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect on the Site includes:</p>

        <h3>Usage Data (via Google Analytics)</h3>
        <p>We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses "cookies" (small text files placed on your computer) to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity for us.</p>
        <p>We will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user.</p>
        <p>You can learn more about Google's practices by going to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâ€™s opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

        <h3>Locally Stored Data</h3>
        <p>To enhance your experience, we store certain preferences and your game score directly in your browser's `localStorage`. This data includes:</p>

        <p>This data is stored only on your device within your browser and is not transmitted to us or any third party. Clearing your browser's cache or site data will remove this information.</p>

        <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>

            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
